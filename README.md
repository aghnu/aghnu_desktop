# AGHNU'S DESKTOP - VANILLA JS
This is a fun frontend project that mimics an os desktop environment, taking inspiration from Gnome 40, Mac, and Windows.

Features:
* calculate the new window's position and size with the reference from its group
* snap to the top, left, and right of the screen with visual cues
* moving and resizing
* recalculate window position on browser window resize

### NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT
I decided to rewrite this project using Vue.js + TypeScript as a way to practice writing Vue.js applications.

VueJS version: https://github.com/aghnu/aghnus_desktop_vuejs
<br/>Vanilla version live demo: https://www.aghnu.me/archive/aghnus_desktop_vanilla/
